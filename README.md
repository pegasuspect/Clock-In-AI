# Clock In.AI Website
Check out the website @ https://www.clockin.ai

The main purpose of this website is to help people use the AI chatbot I am developing. 

The bot is served on AWS and Google Cloud. Its not open-source at the moment. About this repository; you can check out which theme I used below.

### What is this?
A landing page for a Slack chat bot. Integrated with Machine Learning and NLP, it is pretty much like a special version of Alexa or Google Assistant. 

It is specialized in collecting duration and date. Presents this information to team leaders for reducing repetitive conversations about pay-checks.

### Theme
I used jekyll to compile a theme I purchased from Themeforest. 

I have confirmation that I can share the compiled javascript and css from their theme.
